# GeoFS-AeroRevamp
A plugin designed to revamp the Military Roleplay experience within GeoFS by adding a number of useful features to the game. This release is an obtusficated release of the plugin. This means that, when the instructions are followed to install this plugin, it will run, but it is modified in such a way that makes modification impossible. If you wish to make modifications or additions to this plugin, please message me, slappy01 on Discord, and I will send you the un-obtusficated code for modification.

## How to Install
Download the release, which contains a single file, main.user.js. Drag that file into Tampermonkey and it will prompt an installation screen. Click "Download", and the plugin will automatically initialize when opening GeoFS. You will notice when looking at the Tampermonkey icon that the plugin only initializes when opening GeoFS, and is not running on an other website.
